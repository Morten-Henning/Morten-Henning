Hi! I'm a Norwegian freelance web developer based in France, working under the name Norweb. I've been building websites professionally since 2008, and even before that, I was experimenting with web projects driven by curiosity and creativity.

I work across the full stack, writing pure PHP and vanilla JavaScript to build fast, custom solutions. I create tailor-made WordPress themes from scratch, but I’m not tied to one CMS or framework. I enjoy getting close to the code — solving real problems with clean, efficient solutions.

💼 What I Do

🧱 Full-Stack Development — Frontend & backend using raw PHP and JavaScript

🎨 Custom WordPress Themes — Clean, responsive themes built from the ground up

🧠 Laravel (Learning) — Exploring modern PHP frameworks and MVC structure

⚛️ React / React Native — Built small projects using component-based architecture

🤝 Collaboration — Work closely with designers, agencies, and dev teams

🚀 Open to New Projects

I'm currently available for freelance work. Whether you need a lightweight custom theme, a full web application, or a developer who understands both the front and back of the stack — feel free to reach out.
